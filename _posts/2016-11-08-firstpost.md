<h1>How do we represent reality?</h1>

<img src="/post-images/worldmap.jpeg" />

## The biggest challenge cartographers face is representing a spherical world, a 3-D geoid, onto a flat surface. The map above is the map we've all seen a million times. In classrooms, in offices, in government buildings - it's everywhere. However, this Mercator map created in 1596 was solely used to help sailors navigate the oceans. While this image is still accepted as a correct view of the world, it is highly flawed and more recently recognized as such. Major distortion occurs near the poles, making Antartica, Greenland and North America appear larger. The shape of countries is accurate, but wealthier nations often appear larger and more "dominant" than countries in Europe and Africa that are larger in size. Look at the size of the Scandinavian countries, and then compare them to India. They appear larger, but India is 3x (THREE TIMES!) as large as those nations. 

## Every map you've ever seen is an objective depiction of a phenemona that may or may not accurately depict reality. We are influenced, convinced and sold by maps. Take a moment to consider this next time you view a map. As you can see on the image below, we all have our own perspective.
